## Introductions
This project explores the Multi-Element Long Distance Dependency (ME-LDD) in sequential datasets and it's apparent impact on the Language Models (LMs). To synthesize ME-LDDs, we make use of Strictly _k_-Piecewise grammar. By controlling _k_ in the grammar, we are able to control the number of elements in the dependency structure.

## Prerequisite
- [Foma](https://fomafst.github.io/)
- Python 3.6

## Strictly _k_-Piecewise Datasets

### How to generate the datasets

## Language Models Trained
- [Transformer-XL](https://github.com/kimiyoung/transformer-xl)
- [AWD-LSTM](https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm)
